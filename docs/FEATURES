The required features for Fabula are as follows:
    * display the branches and jumps of a mostly linear yet still interactive
      conversation clearly and unambiguously
    * operate independently of a level editor (using variables to tie
      dialogue to characters)
    * support conversations with more than two characters and make it readily
      clear who is speaking to whom
    * be able to access, change, and create global variables and use them to
      affect conversation flow
    * be able to choose randomly between several possible nodes
    * be able to export all or certain dialogue nodes to a professional script
      format
    * support developer comments and voice-over comments that can be included
      in an exported script but not displayed during the game
    * make it easy to associate the audio files with each node
    * support choice nodes that can jump to anywhere in the dialogue files
    * be able to add and edit the player's goals and objectives
    * support HTML-style formatting tags (<b>, <i>, and potentially
      text colors)
    * keep track of which writer has written which dialogue node
    * support several different conversation types: interactive dialogue, 
      overheards, subsequents, and AI barks.
