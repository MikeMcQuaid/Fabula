Fabula is a RPG editor built using Qt. It's designed to be 
cross-platform from the outset for Windows, Mac and Linux.

At the moment I'm the only person working on it. I'm using
OSX 10.6, Qt/Cocoa and Qt Creator so it may not work
perfectly yet on other platforms without a bit of work.

At the moment the code isn't great and the database needs
work. Don't expect to maintain any level of compatibility
at the moment between versions, it's pre-alpha.

If you'd like to help out, feel free to hack on it and
send me patches. If you make a few good ones I'll give
you commit access.

You can see my plan for this in the docs/plan folder. I'm
initially trying to match ConEdit for features and then
extend it beyond that. I've prepared a basic feature list
of what's required before I declare a 1.0 release.

Enjoy!
Mike
