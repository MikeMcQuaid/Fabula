# Fabula
Fabula is a RPG conversation editor built using Qt.
It's designed to be cross-platform for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Building
```
git clone git://github.com/mikemcquaid/Fabula.git
cd Fabula
cmake .
make
```

## Status
Abandoned due to original potential users no longer needing it.
At the moment the code isn't great and the database needs work.
Some of this may be useful to others regardless or as a basis for
another project but I probably won't be working on it any more other
than using it as a simple test project.

You can see my original plan for this in the docs/plan folder.
I was initially trying to match ConEdit for features and then
extend it beyond that.
